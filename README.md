# Scripting for Large Databases

A practical course on working with structured and semi-structured data at scale, focusing on the intersection of data storage and analysis. Students learn foundational data science skills through hands-on work with databases, Python, and modern data analysis tools. Taught at [University of Denver](https://morgridge.du.edu/academic-programs/library-information-science). See the [syllabus](./syllabus.md).

## Course Overview

This course bridges structured data storage and data analysis, teaching:

- Relational database fundamentals and SQL querying
- Python data analysis with the SciPy stack (pandas, NumPy, etc.)
- NoSQL databases with MongoDB
- Data collection and web scraping
- Data transformation and aggregation patterns
- Large-scale data processing concepts

## Learning Approach

- Hands-on labs and practical exercises
- Focus on real-world data analysis scenarios
- Interactive coding sessions using Jupyter/Colab
- Final analysis project applying learned concepts
- Emphasis on collaborative learning

## Prerequisites

No prior programming experience required, though curiosity and willingness to learn technical concepts is essential.

## Tools Used

- Python with SciPy ecosystem (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks via Google Colab
- SQLite for relational databases
- MongoDB for NoSQL
- Additional data science libraries as needed

## Course Structure

Weekly sessions combine lecture with hands-on lab time. Students work through practical exercises with peer support and instructor guidance. Assignments focus on applying concepts to real data analysis challenges.

The course emphasizes practical skills over theory, preparing students to work effectively with large-scale structured data in information science contexts.
